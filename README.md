This project is forked from chrislewis/basic-project.g8 with customization for my development projects.

This is a [giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8) template for removing
the boilerplate in setting up a new scala project:

* `main` and `test` source directories and stubs
* [specs2](http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/)
* SBT simple configuration for `0.12.3`, scala `2.10.1`, and `org.scalatest.scalatest` dependencies
* project `name`, `organization` and `version` customizable as variables
* everything in your project's base package imported automatically in repl sessions
